# Data vizualisation using DimpleJS and D3 : Airline data.


This is a data-viz project vizualisation data using animation and user-interaction(using many design principles).

- index_1.html : I use index.html to display delays with time through all the years. I used DimpleJS Storyboard control for this *animation.*
- index_3.html : I have created a choropleth for delays by US states. I used both :
- - D3js (improve_coloring.html) which needs some work with quantizer.
  - Needs work on user-interaction aspect of the graph.
  - And D3js and GeoMap dependency. This geomap brings some very useful features like tooltip data, zoom on click (to focus) etc.
- Data cleaned, manipulated and analysed using **R**.
